# Verilog

Welcome to my Verilog HDL project repository! This repo includes a collection of hardware designs written in Verilog, along with their corresponding testbenches. These projects are part of my preparation for a career in VLSI.

## Folder Structure
Each folder contains:
- The Verilog design file (`.v`)
- The testbench file (`_tb.v`) for simulation
- The output result

## Tools Used
- **Simulation:** EDA Playground

## Topics Covered
- Combinational Logic (Adders, MUX, Decoder)
- Sequential Circuits (Flip-flops, Counters, FSMs)
- MAC units and Convolution modules
- Finite State Machines (Moore/Mealy)
- Custom Pipelined Designs

## Purpose
This repository is intended for:
- Tracking and improving my Verilog HDL skills
- Sharing useful reference modules for others learning Verilog
- Showcasing my hardware design experience for VLSI job applications
